# FIFERs-FIFA-21-Realism-Mod

This is the open source GitHub of FIFER's FIFA 21 Realism Mod, the biggest mod ever made for FIFA.

This inclues pretty much the whole core Realism Mod mod (ie not faces, tattos, etc), minus some graphics and the compdata.

Rules for using these files:

1. You are not allowed to use any of these files in any way in any other mods that are shared with others, without obtaining permission from me beforehand.
2. You are welcome to use or edit these in any of your own private mods however you want, but of course, if you will share the mod with others at a small or large scale, you must obtain permission from me (see rule 1)

Of course, these are just my modifications. The base files belong to EA.
