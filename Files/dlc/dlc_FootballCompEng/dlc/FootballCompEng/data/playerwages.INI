//Please update PlayerWageDomesticPrestigeMods.csv and PlayerWageProfitabilityMods.csv (MOD) These are important, make sure to tweak them
//when tuning player wages, these files configure the modifier based on the league id
//e.g Premier League(league id:13) has the following modifiers for Profitability [1-10]: 
//13,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100, where the first column is the league id
//If a league Id does not have an entry in this table it will default to the first row modifiers
// (MOD TODO) Edit the PlayerWageDomesticPrestigeMods and PlayerWageProfitabilityMods CSVs for each league
