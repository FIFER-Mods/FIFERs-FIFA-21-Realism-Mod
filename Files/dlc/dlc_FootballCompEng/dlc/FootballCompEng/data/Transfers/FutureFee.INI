// Future fee % is a clause which helps buyers get a player for less by sharing a percent of a future sale of a player once they acquire him.
// The clause can be demanded by: User Buyer/User Seller/AI Seller. The AI as a SELLER cannot demand a FutureFee. (MOD) well thats contradictory lol. looking at line 5 it seems like they mean the AI as a BUYER cannot demand a FutureFee
// Future Fee % is needed as the future sale isn’t guaranteed, so the money will potentially be earned/spent.

// User is BUYER, AI is SELLER - probability that the AI SELLER demands a FutureFee.
// The probability that the AI as seller demands a FutureFee for a transfer is the average of all of the following probabilities.
// The probability that the AI accepts/rejects the clause is based on the same average of probabilities.

// Summary: AI as a Seller proposes a FutureFee if:
// 1. The player is at its lowest potential (chances are he will get better with time).
// 2. The player is as young as possible.
// 3. The player's selling club is rated as low as possible.
// 4. The player'=s selling club financial rating is as high as possible.
// FutureFee amount in percents: The demanded FutureFee is strictly based on the players potential.

// Case 1 - AI is the SELLER (we calculate the percent that the AI demands a future fee, and if it demands it then we also calculate its amount in percents)
